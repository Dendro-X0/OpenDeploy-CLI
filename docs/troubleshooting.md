# Troubleshooting (Vercel)

This page summarizes common provider errors detected by OpenDeploy and actionable remedies. When an operation fails, OpenDeploy maps raw errors to stable codes and prints humanâ€‘friendly guidance. In JSON/NDJSON modes, these appear in the output as `code`, `message`, and optional `remedy` fields.

See implementation: `src/utils/errors.ts`

> Note: Netlify is not supported by OpenDeploy. Please use the official Netlify CLI.

## Vercel

OpenDeploy maps common Vercel CLI issues to human guidance:

- VERCEL_AUTH_REQUIRED
  - Cause: Not logged in to Vercel.
  - Remedy: `vercel login`

- VERCEL_AUTH_EXPIRED
  - Cause: Authentication expired or unauthorized (401).
  - Remedy: `vercel login` (or set `VERCEL_TOKEN` in CI).

- VERCEL_NOT_LINKED
  - Cause: Directory not linked to a project.
  - Remedy: `vercel link` (or pass `--project/--org` in CI).

- VERCEL_INVALID_PROJECT_OR_TEAM
  - Cause: Invalid/unknown Vercel project/org/team.
  - Remedy: Verify `VERCEL_PROJECT_ID` / `VERCEL_ORG_ID` or use `--project/--org`; alternatively run `vercel link`.

- VERCEL_BUILD_FAILED
  - Cause: Build failed during Vercel deployment.
  - Remedy: Inspect logs: `opd deploy logs vercel --follow`; run `next build` locally; check env with `opd env diff` and `opd env validate`.

- NODE_MODULE_NOT_FOUND
  - Cause: Module resolution failed in build.
  - Remedy: Reinstall deps; ensure Node 18/20. (`pnpm install`)

- NEXT_LINT_OR_TYPES_FAILED
  - Cause: ESLint or TypeScript errors failed the build.
  - Remedy: Fix lint/type errors; consider disabling lint in production builds if desired.

- ENV_MISSING
  - Cause: A required environment variable appears to be missing.
  - Remedy: Use `opd env diff` to compare local vs remote; then `opd env sync` to apply.

- PERMISSION_DENIED
  - Cause: Permission denied during an operation.
  - Remedy: Check file permissions and provider access.

- NETWORK_ERROR
  - Cause: Temporary network failure.
  - Remedy: Retry. Check connectivity or provider status.

## Notes

- Human mode prints concise messages with `Try:` suggestions.
- JSON/NDJSON include `code`, `message`, `remedy`, and original `error` text when available.
- GitHub Actions annotations are emitted for doctor and env diff when running in CI.
 - Run `opd doctor --json` to see suggested commands based on linked state and monorepo cwd detection.
