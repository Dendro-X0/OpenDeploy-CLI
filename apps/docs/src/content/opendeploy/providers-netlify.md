# Netlify (Not Supported)

OpenDeploy no longer supports Netlify. For Netlify deployments and environment management, please use the official Netlify CLI and documentation:

- GitHub: https://github.com/netlify/cli
- Docs: https://docs.netlify.com/

OpenDeploy focuses on providers where we deliver the smoothest experience:

- Vercel
- Cloudflare Pages
- GitHub Pages

If you have existing Netlify projects, keep `netlify.toml` in your repo and drive deploys via `netlify deploy` or Netlifyâ€™s CI.
