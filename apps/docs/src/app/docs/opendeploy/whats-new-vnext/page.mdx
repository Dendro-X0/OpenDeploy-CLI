# What's New in vNext

This page summarizes major changes and how to adopt them.

## Highlights

- Plugin‑first architecture for stacks and providers
- Built‑in stack adapters (Next, Astro, SvelteKit, Remix, Nuxt, Vite)
- Redaction‑enforced logging and NDJSON event streams for providers and stacks
- Better framework detection (including Vite) and CI smokes
- Authoring guide for plugin developers

## Plugin Compatibility

OpenDeploy exposes a versioned plugin API. As a rule:

- Major version must match
- Minor/patch may differ

| Component | API version | Policy |
| --- | --- | --- |
| CLI (core) | `1.0.0` | Requires plugin major `1` |
| Stack plugin | `1.x` | Compatible with CLI 1.x |
| Provider plugin | `1.x` | Compatible with CLI 1.x |

When a plugin’s major version does not match the CLI’s `PLUGIN_API_VERSION`, the CLI emits a `version-mismatch` NDJSON warning and will attempt to continue with built‑ins or fallbacks where possible.

See the full contracts at `packages/cli/src/core/plugins/contracts.ts`.

## Migration Notes

- Existing flows continue to work; plugins are used opportunistically when installed.
- Prefer `stackPlugin.build()` output when available; otherwise the provider’s build path is used.
- NDJSON now includes lifecycle events for plugin load/detect/build and provider deploy.
